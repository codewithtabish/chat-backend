// Models:
// A model in MongoDB is a JavaScript representation of a collection, offering an interface 
// for interacting with and querying documents within that collection.

// Collection:
// A collection in MongoDB acts like a folder that stores related documents.

// Document:
// A document in MongoDB is a single JSON-like object representing a piece of data stored within a collection.

// JSONWEBTOKEN (JWT):
// JSONWEBTOKEN is a secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. 
// JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature. It's commonly used for 
// authentication and authorization in web applications. The server creates a JWT upon 
// user login and sends it to the client. The client includes the JWT in every subsequent 
// request to access protected routes. The server verifies the JWT to ensure the request 
// is from the authenticated user with appropriate permissions.

// Multer:
// Multer is middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js. It simplifies the process
// of handling multipart/form-data requests, commonly used for file uploads. Multer 
// provides various features for managing file uploads, including filtering, disk storage 
// options, and more, making it easier to handle file uploads in Node.js applications.

// MIMETYPE:
// A MIME type is a format identifier for files on the Internet, split into a type and subtype 
// like "text/plain" for plain text, "image/jpeg" for JPEG images, and "video/mp4" for MP4 videos.

// Authentication:
// Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting 
// to access a system, application, or resource.

// Authorization:
// Authorization is the process of determining whether the authenticated user or entity 
// has the necessary permission to access certain resources or perform actions within 
// the application or system.

// $addToSet:
// The $addToSet operator in MongoDB is used to add elements to an array if the element 
// does not already exist. It adds unique elements to the array.

// $pull:
// The $pull operator is used to remove elements from an array.

// $push:
// The $push operator is used to add elements to an array in MongoDB, even if the element 
// already exists. Unlike $addToSet, $push does not prevent duplication.
